### Frontend

The frontend of ChatGenius is built using React with TypeScript, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase. Vite is utilized for rapid development and optimized builds, while Tailwind CSS provides a flexible styling framework. The UI components are primarily sourced from shadcn, promoting consistency and accessibility across the application.

**Key Components:**

- **Landing Page**: Allows users to enter their name and join as guests.
- **Chat Interface**: Displays messages, channels, and active users.
- **Message Components**: Individual message items with options to edit or delete.
- **Sidebar**: Contains channel navigation and user lists with toggle functionality.
- **User List**: Displays active users with status indicators.
- **Channel Management**: Enables creation and selection of chat channels.

### Backend & Infrastructure

AWS Amplify manages the deployment and hosting of the application, providing a scalable and reliable infrastructure. Supabase serves as the real-time database, handling data storage for users, messages, and channels. AWS AppSync orchestrates the GraphQL API, facilitating efficient data queries and real-time subscriptions.

**Key Services:**

- **AWS Amplify Hosting**: For deploying the frontend application.
- **Supabase**: Database management, real-time subscriptions, and groundwork for future authentication enhancements.
- **AWS AppSync**: GraphQL API management, enabling data fetching, mutations, and subscriptions for real-time updates.

### Database

Supabase is employed as the primary database solution, offering real-time data capabilities and a familiar SQL interface. The database schema is designed to efficiently handle users, messages, and channels, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance.

### API Layer

AWS AppSync serves as the API gateway, managing GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions. It interfaces with Supabase to perform CRUD operations and ensures that real-time data synchronization is maintained across all connected clients.

---

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend by entering their name on the landing page to join as guests.
2. **Guest Login**:
   - The frontend sends a GraphQL mutation to AppSync to create or retrieve a guest user record in Supabase.
   - Upon successful login, the user's state is managed in the frontend, and they are redirected to the chat interface.
3. **Sending Messages**:
   - Users compose messages in the `MessageInput` component.
   - Upon submission, a GraphQL mutation is sent to AppSync to store the message in Supabase.
   - Optimistic UI updates display the message immediately in the chat window.
4. **Receiving Messages**:
   - AppSync subscriptions listen for new messages in real-time.
   - Incoming messages are pushed to all connected clients, updating the `MessageList` component dynamically.
5. **Channel Management**:
   - Users can create and select channels, with corresponding GraphQL mutations and subscriptions managing the channel data.
6. **User List Updates**:
   - Active user data is fetched and kept up-to-date through GraphQL queries and subscriptions, reflecting real-time user presence.
