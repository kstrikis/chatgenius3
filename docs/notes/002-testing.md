# Testing Implementation

## Cypress E2E Testing Setup (2024-03-19)

### Overview
Adding comprehensive end-to-end testing using Cypress to ensure reliable user interactions and critical path testing. Focus on component testing and full E2E scenarios.

### Goals
- Implement E2E testing for critical user flows
- Set up component testing for React components
- Establish CI/CD pipeline integration
- Create maintainable test patterns and utilities
- Cover key Supabase interactions

### Key Areas for Testing
1. Authentication flows
2. User management operations
3. Real-time subscription behavior
4. Form validations and submissions
5. Error handling and recovery paths
6. Cross-browser compatibility
7. Mobile responsiveness

### Next Steps
1. Install and configure Cypress
2. Set up test environment variables
3. Create first component tests
4. Implement critical path E2E tests
5. Configure CI/CD integration
