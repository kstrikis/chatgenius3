# User List Implementation

## Changes Made
1. Created `ChannelUsersContext` to manage user list state
   - Loads users for the active channel
   - Updates in real-time when users join/leave or change status
   - Properly handles user data from Supabase

2. Fixed Supabase Query Issues
   - Modified queries to properly join with users table
   - Added proper type handling for database responses
   - Fixed snake_case to camelCase conversion

3. Fixed Promise Handling
   - Added proper error handling for async operations
   - Fixed floating promises in event handlers
   - Added proper cleanup for subscriptions

4. Fixed Duplicate Channel Member Issue
   - Added check for existing membership before joining
   - Gracefully handles duplicate join attempts
   - Maintains proper error logging

5. Code Cleanup
   - Removed unused imports and interfaces
   - Fixed ESLint configuration for snake_case fields
   - Improved type safety across contexts

## Testing
- Added end-to-end test for user list functionality
- All core user flow tests passing
- Fixed test selectors to match actual UI elements

## Next Steps
1. Implement unread message count
2. Add user status indicators
3. Add user profile images/avatars
4. Implement direct messaging
