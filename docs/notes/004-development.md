### Recent Improvements
1. Database Integration:
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Created users table with proper schema
   - Implemented RLS policies
   - Added proper indexes
   - Set up guest user management

2. State Management Optimization:
   - Added debouncing for state persistence (1s)
   - Implemented status change delays (2s for online, 5s for away)
   - Added proper cleanup of timeouts
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added state comparison to prevent unnecessary updates

3. Type Safety Improvements:
   - Added proper interfaces for database/app state
   - Implemented mapping layer for case conversion
